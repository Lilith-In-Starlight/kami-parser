# Example Kami File
This kami file contains all the features that a Kami interpreter should have:

*Bold* and **strong** text must be differentiated. Same thing goes for _italicized_ and __emphasized__. \*They can be escaped\* \_like this\_.

It has to be possible to have them *_in combination_ like this*

This is a [hyperlink](ampersandia.net){#example rel="me"}, they can also have ID, Class and all sorts of HTML attributes

##{.subtitle} Headers
They can contain attributes as well. This one has a class.

~Substrings~ and ^superstrings^ can very importantly contain spaces.

{.example-p} A paragraph can also contain attributes

={} This paragraph is justified

>{#rightalign} This one is right-aligned and has an ID

`This is inline code` (yes, it can have attributes). Code blocks are the same but they have three backticks

@this is a span@ (yep. it can also have attributes)
