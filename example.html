<h1 >Example Kami File</h1>
<p>This kami file contains all the features that a Kami interpreter should have:</p>

<p><b >Bold</b> and <strong >strong</strong> text must be differentiated. Same thing goes for <i >italicized</i> and <em >emphasized</em>. *They can be escaped* _like this_.</p>

<p>It has to be possible to have them <b ><i >in combination</i> like this</b></p>

<p>This is a <a href="ampersandia.net" id="example" rel="me">hyperlink</a>, they can also have ID, Class and all sorts of HTML attributes</p>

<h2 class="subtitle" > Headers</h2>
<p>They can contain attributes as well. This one has a class.</p>

<p><sub >Substrings</sub> and <sup >superstrings</sup> can very importantly contain spaces.</p>

<p class="example-p" > A paragraph can also contain attributes</p>

<p>This paragraph is justified</p>

<p id="rightalign" > This one is right-aligned and has an ID</p>

<p><code >This is inline code</code> (yes, it can have attributes). Code blocks are the same but they have three backticks</p>

<p><span >this is a span</span> (yep. it can also have attributes)</p>
